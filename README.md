# PSI-Project
A college project for the autumn semester of 2016-17 for the class of Projecto de Sistemas the Informação (Information Systems Project).

This class tasked their students with building an information system from scratch based on the specifications of a simulated client played by the professor, whom the groups would meet bi-weekly. Each group got a different project. Mine (me and a couple of other colleagues) got tasked with building a software to manage a marriage bureau.

This repository will, of course, hold the code for said system.
